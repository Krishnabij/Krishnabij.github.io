        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Solo Leveling Season 2 Episode 10 brings an action-packed showdown between the **S-Rank Hunters of Korea and Japan**. With rising tensions, powerful fights, and a glimpse into Jinwoo’s true strength, this episode sets the stage for something massive.</p>
        
        <h2>The Battle Begins - Korea vs Japan</h2>
        <p>The episode kicks off with an intense sparring match between **Korea’s elite hunters and Japan’s top fighters**. Jinwoo observes that Goto Ryuji, Japan’s strongest hunter, chooses to **sit back and watch**, rather than participate himself. This makes Jinwoo suspect that Goto is using this fight as a **test to analyze their strength**.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Battles in the Arena</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mad Dong-Wak vs Kenzo:</strong> The brute force battle where Mad Dong-Wak grows in size but struggles against Kenzo’s precise attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Lim Tae-Gyu vs Hoshino:</strong> A long-range vs agility fight, where Lim's arrows prove deadly.</li>
            <li><strong>Baek Yoon-Ho vs Koma Moto:</strong> Baek transforms, but Koma Moto is not a combat-type hunter, making him uneasy.</li>
            <li><strong>Cha Hae-In vs Kanae:</strong> Cha’s battle-dance technique overwhelms Kanae, earning her the nickname "Dancer."</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Jinwoo Enters the Fight</h2>
        <p>As the battles intensify, **Kumamoto loses control** and attempts a lethal attack on Cha Hae-In. Just as things spiral out of hand, Jinwoo **intervenes and stops the fight effortlessly**. Kumamoto, still in rage, tries to attack Jinwoo, but he is swiftly defeated.</p>
        
        <h3>Goto vs Jinwoo - A Duel of Titans</h3>
        <p>After witnessing Jinwoo’s strength, Goto Ryuji himself **challenges Jinwoo to a one-on-one duel**. The fight is unlike anything seen before:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Goto attacks relentlessly, but **Jinwoo dodges every strike with ease**, making it seem like he’s toying with Goto.</li>
            <li>Jinwoo lands a **clean hit but doesn’t finish the fight**, further frustrating Goto.</li>
            <li>Their power levels begin to rise, but before the battle can escalate, **both teams intervene to stop them**.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Jeju Island Raid Approaches</h2>
        <p>With the fight over, attention shifts to the **Jeju Island Raid**. Goto, visibly shaken by Jinwoo’s power, later **contacts his superior** to report that Jinwoo is far beyond a normal hunter. Meanwhile, the **Queen Ant prepares for war**, sensing a greater threat than before.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Episode 10 of Solo Leveling Season 2 lays the groundwork for some **major upcoming battles**. The Korean-Japanese rivalry has been set, Goto is wary of Jinwoo, and the **threat at Jeju Island is growing**. The next episode will be even more intense—stay tuned!</p>
