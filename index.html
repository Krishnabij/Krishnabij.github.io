        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>One Piece Chapter 1142 delivers an action-packed narrative as <strong>Loki finally unleashes his true power</strong>. The chapter is full of foreshadowing, intense battles, and intriguing theories about Elbaf and the Ancient Weapons. Let's dive into the breakdown of this thrilling chapter.</p>
        
        <h2>Loki’s Power Unleashed</h2>
        <p>After being partially freed by <strong>Luffy and Zoro</strong>, Loki remains restrained by a Sea Stone cuff. However, even in a weakened state, he proves his immense strength, wielding his hammer, <em>Rager</em>. His bounty of <strong>2.6 billion berries</strong> already places him among the strongest figures in the One Piece world.</p>
        
        <h3>Rager’s Mysterious Abilities</h3>
        <p>Loki swings <em>Rager</em>, summoning <strong>lightning</strong> that ignites the Treasure Tree Adam. Speculations arise:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Did Rager consume a <strong>Devil Fruit</strong>, similar to other objects in One Piece?</li>
            <li>Could it be connected to <strong>an ancient satellite</strong>, channeling energy from above?</li>
            <li>Or is this a unique form of <strong>Haki infusion</strong>?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>The Fate of Elbaf’s Children</h2>
        <p>Meanwhile, Elbaf's children are being <strong>abducted by the Holy Knights</strong>. The chapter hints that <strong>Killingham</strong> is putting them to sleep, while <strong>Gunko</strong> guides them toward the shore. However, the biggest revelation is <strong>Summers’ Devil Fruit</strong>, which appears to manifest the children's deepest fears into reality.</p>
        
        <h2>Major Foreshadowing & Theories</h2>
        <p>One Piece is known for its deep foreshadowing, and Chapter 1142 is no exception:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Ancient Weapons</strong>: A mysterious <strong>flying ship</strong> depicted on the Adam Tree mural might be <em>Uranus</em> or a different lost weapon.</li>
            <li><strong>Fenrir & Dragon</strong>: Could these be the Zoan-type Devil Fruits of major antagonists like <em>Figarland Garling</em> or <em>Imu</em>?</li>
            <li><strong>Elbaf’s True Purpose</strong>: The country may be split between those who see <em>Nar</em> as a liberator and those who see him as a destroyer.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>One Piece Chapter 1142 is setting the stage for something massive. The ticking clock of the arc has started, and the mysteries surrounding Loki, the Holy Knights, and Elbaf's secrets continue to deepen. What do you think will happen next? Let us know in the comments!</p>
